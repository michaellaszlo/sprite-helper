+ zoom to center
+ resize canvas to fit window

+ bounded panning: not allowed to go beyond the image
+ free panning: allowed to go as long as the border is visible
+ scaled and unscaled panning

+ replace minimumBorderPixels with a border outside the image 

+ correct the problem of ghost panning
  test: click beyond image, drag toward image and off screen, then drag back
  solution: pan the image as soon as the cursor starts dragging back

+ pan with momentum (easing)
+ find out why the indentation is screwy when I look at .js in the browser
+ fix final-sample flaw in pan easing
+ fix the scrollbar gap (appear to have fixed it by waiting for image.onload)

+ display control panel at top

+ make controls unselectable

- calculate bordering polygons (outside and inside)

- polygons
  + clarify the concept
  + define the relationship between polygons and boxes
  + generate zero-threshold polygons
  - add threshold options

- layer selection
  + checkboxes
  + activate checkboxes
  - replace checkboxes with graphical elements
  - add options
    - colors
    - transparency?
    - order?

- layer contents
  + boxes
  + image
  + shadow
  + boundary
  - your polygons

- replace recursive pixel flooding with iterative versions
- alternative way to render shadowContext: make imageData and write directly

- pixel inspector
  - rgba
  - hex
  - coordinates

- manually draw polygon
  - add point
  - move point
  - delete point

- automatically compute polygon
  - choose pixel threshold

- generate code
- code options

- zoom toward mouse
- zooming mode: toward mouse or toward center
- option: animate bounding box upon zooming

- impose limits on zoom-in and zoom-out

widgets:
+ reset button
- display zoom level
- zoom in, zoom out
- panning limit: bound or free
- panning release: abrupt or fling
- zoom scale: constant, fibonacci, exponential, what else?
- panning speed: unscaled, semi-scaled, scaled
- panel location: top, bottom, left, right
- show map of view relative to scaled image

- configure control panel for display at bottom, left, right

- tidy up the page initialization process
- display a message while the image is loading

- cross-platform scaling?

- color pickers
  - background
  - bounding box
  - bounding border
