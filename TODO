+ zoom to center
+ resize canvas to fit window

+ bounded panning: not allowed to go beyond the image
+ free panning: allowed to go as long as the border is visible
+ scaled and unscaled panning

+ replace minimumBorderPixels with a border outside the image 

+ correct the problem of ghost panning
  test: click beyond image, drag toward image and off screen, then drag back
  solution: pan the image as soon as the cursor starts dragging back

+ pan with momentum (easing)
+ find out why the indentation is screwy when I look at .js in the browser
+ fix final-sample flaw in pan easing
